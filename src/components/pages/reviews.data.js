    body: `"Sophia is a gem in our local dance community and one of my first bachata instructors. She's
            attentive to the level differential of the students in her workshops and focuses on the way we
            move ourselves as dancers and connect with our partners. I've taken a few classes from her in the
            Iowa City and surrounding areas and leave each time with a critical nugget to practice and improve
            in my social dancing. I have my roots in the swing dance community and what's great is I've been
            able to apply what I've learned in our bachata lessons back to blues, east coast, and lindy hop!
            She blew my mind this past weekend in her science of turns class. I left with ideas for about 80
            variations to the basic inside/outside turns and key points for how to more clearly communicate
            with my partner. Thanks for traveling up to teach us in Cedar Rapids Sophia! I look forward to my
            next class with you soon."`,
